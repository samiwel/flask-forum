# flask-forum

A personal project to create a forum website, similar to how forums used to be in the old days.

This project is mostly just a learning exercise to learn Flask.

## Getting started

1. Activate the virtual environment.

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

1. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Run the application

    ```bash
    FLASK_APP=app.py python app.py
    ```

The website should now be running on http://localhost:5000
